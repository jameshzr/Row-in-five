First-year Introduction to Computer Programming course work
The motivation of choosing Gomoku which is also called row in five as my Python project is Gomoku is a straightforward chess game, however, it is also extremely hard to be master. The two main goals of this project were building Player vs Player (PVP) mode and Player vs Environment (PVE) mode. Both two modes are accomplished in this game.
The rules of Gomoku are simple. Firstly, the black piece always goes first and the white piece goes after it, and in each turn, only one piece can be put on the board for each colour. Secondly, if 5 continuously same colour pieces are in a straight line in any directions, that colour wins (Win condition). After choosing the mode, please enter the playerâ€™s name in the shell. In the game, pieces can be put on the board by simply clicking the junction of the lines on the board.
